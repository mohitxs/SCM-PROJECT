        <h2>About the Online Voting System</h2>
        <p>
            The Online Voting System is an innovative platform designed to streamline the voting process, making it more accessible,
            secure, and efficient. With this system, eligible voters can participate in elections or polls remotely, ensuring that their votes are cast securely and accurately.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Secure Voting:</strong> End-to-end encryption ensures the integrity and privacy of votes.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple User Interface:</strong> Easy-to-use interface, designed for voters of all technical levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Results:</strong> Election results are immediately available after polls close, ensuring transparency.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Device Support:</strong> Accessible on any device, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The system is designed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities, following web accessibility guidelines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            Once registered, voters can log in using secure credentials. After authentication, voters can review the candidates or poll options, 
            select their preferred choice, and submit their vote. The vote is encrypted and stored in a secure database. 
            After the poll closes, results are processed and published instantly, ensuring immediate access to final outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>Security Measures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SSL Encryption:</strong> All communication between users and the system is secured using SSL encryption to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Voters use a two-step verification process to ensure their identity before casting a vote.</li>
            <li><strong>Vote Integrity:</strong> Voter ballots are anonymized, ensuring that no one can trace a vote back to an individual.</li>
            
        </ul>
